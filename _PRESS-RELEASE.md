## Sub-Heading ##
 > A social app that encourages spontaneity by displaying the most active local venues/events in real time.

## Summary ##
 > The product will allow users to see a map displaying the activity/vibe level of which venues have the most people there in real time. On each venue’s page, users have the ability to check-in and rate a venue, join the conversation, take videos and pictures, and direct message other users.

## Problem ##
 > How often have you (and friends) wanted to go out, but weren’t sure what to do or where to go near you or at a certain location? How many people are at a venue/event, and what is the current vibe? What are people saying and seeing at a venue/event?

## Solution ##
 > Our app can quickly and effectively display the atmosphere/vibe within a close proximity on a map. Selecting a venue will display the current activity and general vibe. Users can get insight into what’s happening at the venue via video/photo streams and comments from users who are actually at the venue.
